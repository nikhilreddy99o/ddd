Hi Rai,

Apologies for the delay. Following the correct bank process took some time. I’m now able to connect with Siva to record the video, as only two laptops were upgraded to Ultra Enterprise, so OBS will not get stuck.

The EARC for Grafana was approved today. Chandra confirmed that I can use Grafana and Prometheus. I’ll prepare a demo, possibly by Thursday or Friday.

Once it’s installed, I need two plugins—Trino and Oracle—which must be downloaded from Grafana. I can't download them directly in the pod due to GIS security restrictions. Paula or Rajesh will need to download the plugin ZIPs and send them to me so I can include them.

Sourav, if you install OBS, try to run it and let me know. Your CPU might hit 100% usage while it's running.

Let me know if you'd like to include a status update or estimated timelines.
