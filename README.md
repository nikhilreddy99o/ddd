Hi,

Is there a way we can monitor the drive size and trigger an alert if it crosses 1GB? This would help avoid situations where someone stores a file and forgets about it.

Additionally, can we set permissions to automatically delete files after a certain date and configure alert limits accordingly?

Thank you.
