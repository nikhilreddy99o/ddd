Hi Greg,

While trying to manually update the roles in the AMI production environment, we encountered an issueâ€” the audit access log queue is full. We discovered this today.

Based on the suggestion from the Starburst team (link), we may need to adjust some configuration values to resolve this. Can we plan to include these changes in the upcoming May 19 release?

Additionally, we recommend testing this in the lower environments before applying any role changes in production.
