Subject:Action Required: Materialized View Creation for Issue Resolution

Hi Vikas,

Good morning. As discussed, I’m from the Starburst team and currently working on your ticket.

We’ve tried both manual and automated methods, including updating roles and BIAC, but nothing has worked so far.

As a next step, could you please create a new **Materialized View** and test if the issue persists?
Meanwhile, I’ve also escalated this to the Starburst support team and am actively working with them to investigate further.

Please let me know once the view is created so we can proceed with validation.

Best regards,
