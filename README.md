Hi Zeb,

I think the May 19th CRQ is being considered as the adoption date for our team. That’s why the Octane evidence will reflect from this CRQ onward. Prior to this, there were no tests executed in Octane, which is why Victoria didn’t see any evidence before.

Please let me know if you need further clarification.

Thanks,
Nikhil
