Hi Paula,

I’ve already recorded a demo video and am currently working on some final edits. I can share a snapshot video link that anyone can access it for full details. This will help viewers easily understand the process from installation to completion, along with useful tips and tricks.

If still needed, I’m happy to conduct a live demo as well.
